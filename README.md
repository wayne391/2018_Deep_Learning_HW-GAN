# Tutorial Materials for Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs)

A general introduction of GAN for the lab seminar. This repository is organized as the following:

### datasets
    Basic datasets.
    For images, we have cifar-10 and mnist.
    For the music, we offer the 'tab' dataset. We represents the music in so called 'piano-roll' fromat,
    which is a binary and sparse tensor.

### slides
    Slides for related works.

### topics
    Implementation of the aforementioned topics in the slides. All are written in Tenseoflow.
- single image genration:  
    SN-GAN, WGAN-GP  

- conditional generation:    
    concatenation, ACGAN
